### Course Information:
This course provides an introduction to bioinformatics and computational genomics. The course is geared toward the student with a biology background and limited programming experience. Coursework will be completed almost exclusively in the UNIX/Linux computing environment and students will learn to program using Python. Students will learn: how to reframe biological problems into computationally tractable questions, basic computational biology algorithms, analyses of genome and transcriptome data.

### Problem Statement:

Find the orthologs among the 5 species of beetles and annotate the orthologs.

### List of things to do:
- Construct a _de novo_ transcriptome assembly.
	- Why _de novo_ assembly?
		- Low Mapping against the closest reference species.
- Run BUSCO to check the quality of the assembly.
- Cluster similar sequences together.
- Run BUSCO to check the quality of the assembly.
- Quantify the expression for each gene.
- Retain only the highest expressed Isoform for each gene.
- Run BUSCO to check the quality of the assembly.
- Find Orthologs among 5 species.
	- Run all vs all BLAST among 5 species.
	- Pick the reciprocal Best BLAST hit (RBBH).
	- Run a 5 way script to pull out the orthologs among 5 species.
